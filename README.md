Small project about simulating physics of spaceships. Current state - 

Textures for Armor, Power Lines, Generators, Engines, Capacitors.



Plans: 

Ship building

Mass and rotation calculation

Energy use ( movement, firing )

Mass and energy balance.



Future:

Heat - 
coolant lines, move heat from exchanger to radiators
radiators, takes heat from coolant lines and releases it into the void
heat exchanger, take heat from compnent and inserts it into cooland lines

Layers -
2 by 2 layers extending into layers above and below
transfer between layers
mass calculation union between layers

Open Space -
Simulation of ship in space
Gravity
Movement

Procedural Ship Generation

Ship AI

Sensors -
Different sensor types:
Gravity Sensor, based on mass of ship
Heat Sensor, based on heat output of ship
Optical Sensor, based on size and brightness of ship
