Small project about simulating physics of spaceships. Current state - 

Textures for Armor, Power Lines, Generators, Engines, Capacitors.



Plans: 

Ship building
Mass and rotation calculation
Energy use ( movement, firing )


Heat - 
coolant lines, move heat from exchanger to radiators
radiators, takes heat from coolant lines and releases it into the void
heat exchanger, take heat from compnent and inserts it into cooland lines
